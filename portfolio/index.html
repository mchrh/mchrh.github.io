    <!-- a bit about myself -->
    <div class="about">
      <h1>I design and craft experiences for humans.</h1>
      <div class="text">
            <p>Currently serving as the Creative Director at <a href="http://bobox.ma">Bobox</a>, a young startup based out of sunny Morocco, and taking on selected design freelance work. Interned at <a href="http://synergie-media.com">Synergie Media</a>, a digital agency, wrote & designed stuff for <a href="http://thenexties.com">The Nexties</a> and led the iOS 7 redesign of Koos as the only interface designer. And freelanced for various companies & clients all over the world. My name is Othmane, and I’m a designer. I live in Agadir and I've always been curious. Curious about how things were made. And most importantly who made them. Asking questions has always - and still is - one of the things that I care the most about.
            You can take a look at my résumé. Check my tweets on <a href="http//twitter.com/mchrh">Twitter</a>. I get feedback about my designs on <a href="http://dribbble.com/othmane">Dribbble</a>. I chat with family & friends on <a href="http://facebook.com/othmnmchrh">Facebook</a>. I write code and put it on <a href="http://github.com/mchrh">GitHub</a>. And more importantly, I try to make awesome stuff.
            If I’m not in front of a screen you’d probably find me, reading a book about physics, watching a football game, writing an article for The Nexties, going to the beach for a swim or practicing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aikido">Aikido</a>. I'm also learning the ins and outs of iOS development in my spare time.<br/>
            You can <a href="mailto:othmachrouh@gmail.com">get in touch</a> with me for work inquiries, or if you need advices, or just for saying hi !
