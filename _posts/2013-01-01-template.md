title: "Covering a gaming salon"
---

I thought — just like everyone else — that covering a gaming salon would be easy. Oh god, I’ve never been so wrong.
I thought that it would be all about playing. But it isn’t. You got to walk a lot (something like 15 to 20 Km / day), you got to run from appointment to appointment, which is sometimes pretty hard to achieve especially if you only have 5 minutes to go from the hall 4 to the hall 10.

Especially that I was covering the show alone, which means that I had to run from the entertainement area, to the business area, and then come back, over and over.
I always liked the gaming events, but now that I’m writing, and that’s my job, it became harder from some pretty obvious reasons. I used to come, and play, take pictures, discuss things with people, now I’m handing business cards with my name on it, to a bunch of people wearing suits. And then you go back to the hotel, and you got to write the previews of all the things you saw that day. Which implicates sleeping at 01:00 or 02:00 a.m and waking up at 6:30 in the morning.
But there’s also pros on covering gaming salons, you can talk with developers about their games, learn more about their philosophy so you get a better understanding of the game, and what led the developer to make the choices they made. You also can play games that won’t be released until one or two years from now, which is pretty awesome.
